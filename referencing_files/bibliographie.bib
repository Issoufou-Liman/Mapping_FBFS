abstract = {Channel networks with artibtrary drainage density or resolution can be extracted from digital elevation data. However, for digital elevation data derived networks to be useful they have to be extracted at the correct length scale or drainage density. Here we suggest a criterion for determining the appropriate drainage density at which to extract networks from digital elevation data. The criterion is basically to extract the highest resolution (highest drainage density) network that satisfies scaling laws that have traditionally been found to hold for channel networks. Procedures that use this criterion are presented and tested on 21 digital elevation data sets well distributed throughout the U.S.},

abstract = {Regional phenology is important in ecosystem simulation models and coupled biosphere/atmosphere models. In the continental United States, the timing of the onset of greenness in the spring (leaf expansion, grass green-up) and offset of greenness in the fall (leaf abscission, cessation of height growth, grass brown-off) are strongly influenced by meteorological and climatological conditions. We developed predictive phenology models based on traditional phenology research using commonly available meteorological and climatological data. Predictions were compared with satellite phenology observations at numerous 20 km x 20 km contiguous landcover sites. Onset mean absolute error was 7.2 days in the deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) biome and 6.1 days in the grassland biome. Offset mean absolute error was 5.3 days in the DBF biome and 6.3 days in the grassland biome. Maximum expected errors at a 95{\%} probability level ranged from 10 to 14 days. Onset was strongly associated with temperature summations in both grassland and DBF biomes; DBF offset was best predicted with a photoperiod function, while grassland offset required a combination of precipitation and temperature controls. A long-term regional test of the DBF onset model captured field-measured interannual variability trends in lilac phenology. Continental application of the phenology models for 1990-1992 revealed extensive interannual variability in onset and offset. Median continental growing season length ranged from a low of 129 days in 1991 to a high of 146 days in 1992. Potential uses of the models include regulation of the timing and length of the growing season in large-scale biogeochemical models and monitoring vegetation response to interannual climatic variability.},

abstract = {Stepwise key spectrum selection (SKSS) was introduced to resolve batch overlapping peaks from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of ten batch tobacco flavoring samples in different storage times. Resolution was implemented on a software platform that embedded the SKSS method. The data from GC-MS analysis of the samples were saved and prepared in ASCII files and then were inputted into the software platform for visual inspections. The data segment with overlapping peaks was precut for subsequent analysis. Spectral background in the data was removed using a linear fitting of the baseline. Four components in the overlapping peaks were automatically detected by the SKSS method. The resolution of the concentration profiles and spectra of the four components was conducted by setting only one parameter, the negative area ratio, as 0.01. The fixed size moving window evolving factor analysis and evolving factor analysis were applied to validate the resolved concentration profiles. The resolved mass spectra were validated by the searched standard through library search at the pure component regions revealed by the resolved concentration profiles. The results showed that the SKSS method could be a simple but powerful tool in resolving batch chromatographic overlapping peaks.},

abstract = {State and transition models provide a simple and versatile way of describing vegetation dynamics in rangelands. However, state and transition models are traditionally descriptive, which has limited their practical application to rangeland management decision support. This paper demonstrates an approach to rangeland management decision support that combines a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network to provide a relatively simple and updatable rangeland dynamics model that can accommodate uncertainty and be used for scenario, diagnostic, and sensitivity analysis. A state and transition model, developed by the authors for subtropical grassland in south-east Queensland, Australia, is used as an example. From the state and transition model, an influence diagram was built to show the possible transitions among states and the factors influencing each transition. The influence diagram was populated with probabilities to produce a predictive model in the form of a Bayesian belief network. The behaviour of the model was tested using scenario and sensitivity analysis, revealing that selective grazing, grazing pressure, and soil nutrition were believed to influence most transitions, while fire frequency and the frequency of good wet seasons were also important in some transitions. Overall, the integration of a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network provided a useful way to utilise the knowledge embedded in a state and transition model for predictive purposes. Using a Bayesian belief network in the modelling approach allowed uncertainty and variability to be explicitly accommodated in the modelling process, and expert knowledge to be utilised in model development. The methods used also supported learning from monitoring data, thereby supporting adaptive rangeland management. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Software tools have been developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center to extract topographic structure and to delineate watersheds and overland flow paths from digital elevation models. The tools are special-purpose FORTRAN programs interfaced with general-purpose raster and vector spatial analysis and relational data base management packages. The first phase of analysis is a conditioning phase that generates three data sets: the original OEM with depressions filled, a data set indicating the flow direction for each cell, and a flow accumulation data set in which each cell receives a value equal to the total number of cells that drain to it. The original OEM and these three derivative data sets can then be processed in a variety of ways to optionally delineate drainage networks, overland paths, watersheds for user-specified locations, sub-watersheds for the major tributaries of a drainage network, or pour point linkages between watersheds. The computer-generated drainage lines and watershed polygons and the pour point linkage information can be transferred to vector-based geographic information systems for futher analysis. Comparisons between these computer-generated features and their manually delineated counterparts generally show close agreement, indicating that these software tools will save analyst time spent in manual interpretation and digitizing. Previous research has almost universally recognized that depressions, areas surrounded by higher elevation values, in the OEM data are the nemesis of determining hydrologic flow directions because the depressions must fill before the flow can continue. Some depressions are data errors introduced in the surface generation process, while others represent real topo-graphic features such as quarries or natural potholes. A few researchers have attempted to remove depressions by smooth-ing the OEM data (O'Callaghan and Mark, 1984; Mark, 1983). The smoothing approach removes shallow depressions, but deeper depressions remain. A second approach is to "fill" depressions by increasing the values of cells in each depression to the value of the cell with the lowest value on the depressions boundary. Algorithms for filling depressions with the second approach, presented by Marks et al. (1984) and Jenson and Trau-twein (1987), will be discussed later. Collins (1975) presented an algorithm for filling depressions; however, it fails to fully accommodate flat areas as shown by Douglas (1986). These algorit{\ldots}},

Firstly, the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM) tool was used to compute flow directions and contributing areas using a D-infinity (Dinf) algorithm (Tarboton, 1997). Secondly, the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) was computed from Dinf contributing areas and slopes using an Arc Macro Language (AML) program implemented in ArcInfo. Thirdly, a soil landscape facet grid layer was generated from CTI grid and soil landscape shape files using automated routines developed in ArcGIS 9.0. These routines derive soil landscape facets from parent soil landscapes layers based on CTI values that underlie the parent soil landscape. Specific focal functions were used to remove speckles or null cells (e.g. gaps at the landscape boundaries) in the output grids. Finally, the output facet grid layer was overlain or linked with other relevant GIS layers and databases to derive thematic information such as capability ratings and feasibility scores for various land use purposes.},

abstract = {Land surface topography is one of the most important terrain properties which impact hydrological, geomorphological, and ecological processes active on a landscape. In our previous efforts to develop a soil depth model based upon topographic and land cover variables, we derived a set of hydrological proximity measures (HPMs) from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) as potential explanatory variables for soil depth. These HPMs are variations of the distance up to ridge points (cells with no incoming flow) and variations of the distance down to stream points (cells with a contributing area greater than a threshold), following the flow path. The HPMs were computed using the D-infinity flow model that apportions flow between adjacent neighbors based on the direction of steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets constructed in a 3√ó3 grid cell window using the center cell and each pair of adjacent neighboring grid cells in turn. The D-infinity model typically results in multiple flow paths between 2 points on the topography, with the result that distances may be computed as the minimum, maximum or average of the individual flow paths. In addition, each of the HPMs, are calculated vertically, horizontally, and along the land surface. Previously, these HPMs were calculated using recursive serial algorithms which suffered from stack overflow problems when used to process large datasets, limiting the size of DEMs that could be analyzed. To overcome this limitation, we developed a message passing interface (MPI) parallel approach designed to both increase the size and speed with which these HPMs are computed. The parallel HPM algorithms spatially partition the input grid into stripes which are each assigned to separate processes for computation. Each of those processes then uses a queue data structure to order the processing of cells so that each cell is visited only once and the cross-process communications that are a standard part of MPI are handled in an efficient manner. This parallel approach allows efficient analysis of much larger DEMs than were possible using the serial recursive algorithms. The HPMs given here may also have other, more general modeling applicability in hydrology, geomorphology and ecology, and so are described here from a general perspective. In this paper, we present the definitions of the HPMs, the serial and parallel algorithms used in their computation and their potential applications. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In each case study, I examine how expert opinion informed the model and the potential pitfalls that could result, especially in data-limited situations. I discuss two opposing schools of thought: (1) experts provide a valuable source of information that can offer useful insights into a model and (2) expert priors are most times biased, leading to incorrect results and bad decisions. I show that expert opinion has a place in ecological analyses if carefully structured in a model. In situations in which data are limited or simply not available, steps can be taken to ensure its proper use and interpretation from models so decisions can be made urgently and updated when new data becomes available.},

abstract = {The first near-global high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth has recently been released following the successful Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) of 2000. This data set will have applications in a wide range of fields and will be especially valuable in the Earth sciences. Prior to widespread dissemination and use, it is important to acquire knowledge regarding the accuracy characteristics. In this work a comprehensive analysis of the vertical errors present in the data set and the assessment of their effects on different hydrogeomorphic products is performed. In particular, the work consisted of (1) measuring the vertical accuracy of the data set in two areas with different topographic characteristics; (2) characterizing the error structure by comparing elevation residuals with terrain attributes; (3) assessing a wavelet-based filter for removing speckle; and (4) assessing the effects of vertical errors on hydrogeomorphic products and on slope stability modeling. The results indicate that in the two sites, relief has a strong effect on the vertical accuracy of the SRTM DEM. In the high-relief terrain, large errors and data voids are frequent, and their location is strongly influenced by topography, while in the low- to medium-relief site, errors are smaller, although the hilly terrain still produces an effect on the sign of the errors. Speckling generates deviations in the drainage network in one of the investigated areas, but the application of a wavelet filter proved to be an effective tool for removing vertical noise, although further fine tuning is necessary. Vertical errors cause differences in automatically extracted hydrogeomorphic products that range between 4 and 1090.},

Visual interpretations of a conveniently selected image were undertaken to identify and select sample points of interest. The NDVI and Ts values (computed from multi-date images that represented the crop growing period) of the sample points were used to developed typical NDVI and Ts plots. By analyzing these plots and the cropping calendar, an NDVI and Ts threshold-based algorithm was developed to extract the cultivated area of a given season. Analysis of the developed algorithm showed that it was simple, easily modifiable, and had interpretable rules and threshold values.

We first assess the abstractions and demands for water upstream and the river water supplies at the upper and the lower end of the Lorian Swamp. Further analysis of 12 years of monthly SPOT-VEGETATION satellite imagery reveals higher NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) values in the swamp than nearby rainfed areas, with the difference in NDVI between the two positively related to river water discharged into the swamp. The paper next reviews the benefits derived from water entering the swamp and the vulnerability to abstractions for three categories of water: (i) the surface water used for drinking and sanitation; (ii) the surface water that supports forage production; and (iii) the water that recharges the Merti Aquifer. Our results suggest that benefits from surface water for domestic use and forage production are vulnerable to abstractions upstream whereas the benefits from the aquifer, with significant fossil water, are likely to be affected in the long run, but not the short term.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Geophysical Union. Governments around the world have agreed to end hunger and food insecurity and to improve global nutrition, largely through changes to agriculture and food systems. However, they are faced with a lot of uncertainty when making policy decisions, since any agricultural changes will influence social and biophysical systems, which could yield either positive or negative nutrition outcomes. We outline a holistic probability modeling approach with Bayesian Network (BN) models for nutritional impacts resulting from agricultural development policy. The approach includes the elicitation of expert knowledge for impact model development, including sensitivity analysis and value of information calculations. It aims at a generalizable methodology that can be applied in a wide range of contexts. To showcase this approach, we develop an impact model of Vision 2040, Uganda's development strategy, which, among other objectives, seeks to transform the country's agricultural landscape from traditional systems to large-scale commercial agriculture. Model results suggest that Vision 2040 is likely to have negative outcomes for the rural livelihoods it intends to support; it may have no appreciable influence on household hunger but, by influencing preferences for and access to quality nutritional foods, may increase the prevalence of micronutrient deficiency.

Yet, little information is available to help a researcher decide whether expert opinion is useful for their model, how an elicitation should be conducted, what the most relevant method for elicitation is and how this can be translated into prior distributions for analysis in a Bayesian model. In this study, we provide guidance in using expert knowledge in a transparent and credible manner to inform ecological models and ultimately natural resource and conservation decision-making. We illustrate the decisions faced when considering the use of expert knowledge in a model with the help of two real ecological case studies. These examples are explored further to examine the impact of expert knowledge through ‚Äòpriors' in Bayesian modeling and specifically how to minimize potential bias. Finally, we make recommendations on the use of expert opinion in ecology. We believe if expert knowledge is elicited and incorporated into ecological models with the same level of rigour provided in the collection and use of empirical data, expert knowledge can increase the precision of models and facilitate informed decision-making in a cost-effective manner.},

abstract = {Spate irrigation is an ancient practice by which floodwater is diverted from its river bed and channelled to basins where it is used to irrigate crops and feed drinking-water ponds, serve forest and grazing land and recharge local aquifers. It has evolved over the centuries and provided rural populations in arid and semi-arid regions with an ingenious way to cope with the aridity of their climate. It is thought that spate irrigation started in presentday Yemen, where it has been practised for around five thousand years. Today, spate irrigation covers more than 3 million hectares across the world. Although its extent is relatively minor compared to other types of irrigation, it represents a unique option for the management of scarce water resources in support of agricultural production and rural livelihoods in many arid regions. Spate irrigation has been largely neglected in the technical literature. There are no available guidelines that discuss the specificities of spate irrigation. Yet it is different from conventional irrigation in many ways and therefore needs special skills and approaches of which practitioners are not always aware. In particular, standard design approaches cannot appropriately take into account the level of uncertainty related to floods, the hydraulic challenge of guiding flood flows, the heavy sediment loads, the exceptional nature of the water rights, or the management and maintenance models that are specific to spate irrigation. The main objective of this publication is therefore to assist planners and practitioners in designing and managing spate irrigation projects. It covers hydrology, engineering, agronomy, local organizations and rules, wadi basin management and the economics. It is designed to be both a practical guidance document and a source of information and examples based extensively on experience from around the world in areas where spate irrigation is practised.},

abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 $\mu$m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 $\mu$m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (p(0.86 $\mu$m) - $\rho$(1.24 $\mu$m))/($\rho$(0.86 $\mu$m) + $\rho$(1.24 $\mu$m)), where $\rho$ represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-$\mu$m and the 1.24-$\mu$m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 $\mu$m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 $\mu$m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 $\mu$m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-$\mu$m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 $\mu$m. NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

abstract = {Many studies on birds focus on the collection of data through an experimental design, suitable for investigation in a classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework. Although many findings are confirmed by one or more experts, expert information is rarely used in conjunction with the survey data to enhance the explanatory and predictive power of the model. We explore this neglected aspect of ecological modelling through a study on Australian woodland birds, focusing on the potential impact of different intensities of commercial cattle grazing on bird density in woodland habitat. We examine a number of Bayesian hierarchical random effects models, which cater for overdispersion and a high frequency of zeros in the data using WinBUGS and explore the variation between and within different grazing regimes and species. The impact and value of expert information is investigated through the inclusion of priors that reflect the experience of 20 experts in the field of bird responses to disturbance. Results indicate that expert information moderates the survey data, especially in situations where there are little or no data. When experts agreed, credible intervals for predictions were tightened considerably. When experts failed to agree, results were similar to those evaluated in the absence of expert information. Overall, we found that without expert opinion our knowledge was quite weak. The fact that the survey data is quite consistent, in general, with expert opinion shows that we do know something about birds and grazing and we could learn a lot faster if we used this approach more in ecology, where data are scarce.

abstract = {Identifying managed flooding in paddy fields is commonly used in remote sensing to detect rice. Such flooding, followed by rapid vegetation growth, is a reliable indicator to discriminate rice. Spectral indices (SIs) are often used to perform this task. However, little work has been done on determining which spectral combination in the form of Normalised Difference Spectral Indices (NDSIs) is most appropriate for surface water detection or which thresholds are most robust to separate water from other surfaces in operational contexts. To address this, we conducted analyses on satellite and field spectral data from an agronomic experiment as well as on real farming situations with different soil and plant conditions. Firstly, we review and select NDSIs proposed in the literature, including a new combination of visible and shortwave infrared bands. Secondly, we analyse spectroradiometric field data and satellite data to evaluate mixed pixel effects. Thirdly, we analyse MODIS data and Landsat data at four sites in Europe and Asia to assess NDSI performance in real-world conditions. Finally, we test the performance of the NDSIs on MODIS temporal profiles in the four sites. We also compared the NDSIs against a combined index previously used for agronomic flood detection. Analyses suggest that NDSIs using MODIS bands 4 and 7, 1 and 7, 4 and 6 or 1 and 6 perform best. A common threshold for each NDSI across all sites was more appropriate than locally adaptive thresholds. In general, NDSIs that use band 7 have a negligible increase in Commission Error over those that use band 6 but are more sensitive to water presence in mixed land cover conditions typical of moderate spatial resolution analyses. The best performing NDSI is comparable to the combined index but with less variability in performance across sites, suggesting a more succinct and robust flood detection method.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Monitoring vegetation dynamics and their responses to climate change has been the subject of considerable research. This paper aims to detect change trends in grassland activity on the Tibetan Plateau between 1982 and 2006 and relate these to changes in climate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Grassland activity was analyzed by evaluating remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected at 15-day intervals between 1982 and 2006. The timings of vegetation stages (start of green-up, beginning of the growing season, plant maturity, start of senescence and end of the growing season) were assessed using the NDVI ratio method. Mean NDVI values were determined for major vegetation stages (green-up, fast growth, maturity and senescence). All vegetation variables were linked with datasets of monthly temperature and precipitation, and correlations between variables were established using Partial Least Squares regression. Most parts of the Tibetan Plateau showed significantly increasing temperatures, as well as clear advances in late season phenological stages by several weeks. Rainfall trends and significant long-term changes in early season phenology occurred on small parts of the plateau. Vegetation activity increased significantly for all vegetation stages. Most of these changes were related to increasing temperatures during the growing season and in some cases during the previous winter. Precipitation effects appeared less pronounced. Warming thus appears to have shortened the growing season, while increasing vegetation activity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Shortening of the growing season despite a longer thermally favorable period implies that vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau is unable to exploit additional thermal resources availed by climate change. Ecosystem composition may no longer be well attuned to the local temperature regime, which has changed rapidly over the past three decades. This apparent lag of the vegetation assemblage behind changes in climate should be taken into account when projecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystem processes.},

With a horizontal resolution of 3 arc sec, SRTM represents the best quality, freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) worldwide. Since the SRTM elevation data are unedited, they contain occasional voids, or gaps, where the terrain lay in the radar beam's shadow or in areas of extremely low radar backscatter, such as sea, dams, lakes and virtually any water-covered surface. In contrast to the short duration of the SRTM mission, the ongoing Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is continuously collecting elevation information with a horizontal resolution of 15 m. In this paper we compared DEM products created from SRTM data with respective products created from ASTER stereo-pairs. The study areas were located in Crete, Greece. Absolute DEMs produced photogrammetricaly from ASTER using differentially corrected GPS measurements provided the benchmark to infer vertical and planimetric accuracy of the 3 arc sec finished SRTM product. Spatial filters were used to detect and remove the voids, as well as to interpolate the missing values in DEMs. Comparison between SRTM- and ASTER-derived DEMs allowed a qualitative assessment of the horizontal and vertical component of the error, while statistical measures were used to estimate their vertical accuracy. Elevation difference between SRTM and ASTER products was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which was found to be less than 50 m.},

By combining morphometric analysis and visual interpretation based on Landsat 8 satellite data and derived images such as water index (NDWI) images, areas with relatively higher soil moisture and recently deposited sediments were identified. The resulting maps of weighted overlay procedures, aggregating causal, morphometric factors influencing the susceptibility to flooding (lowest height levels, flattest areas), allowed for the distinguishing of areas with higher, medium and lower susceptibility to flooding. Thus, GIS and remote sensing tools contribut to the recognition and mapping of areas and infrastructure prone to flooding in the Guelmim area.},

abstract = {Climate change has caused advances in spring phases of many plant species. Theoretically, however, strong warming in winter could slow the fulfillment of chilling requirements, which may delay spring phenology. This phenomenon should be particularly pronounced in regions that are experiencing rapid temperature increases and are characterized by highly temperature-responsive vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ratio method to determine the beginning, end, and length of the growing season of meadow and steppe vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau in Western China between 1982 and 2006. We then correlated observed phenological dates with monthly temperatures for the entire period on record. For both vegetation types, spring phenology initially advanced, but started retreating in the mid-1990s in spite of continued warming. Together with an advancing end of the growing season for steppe vegetation, this led to a shortening of the growing period. Partial least-squares regression indicated that temperatures in both winter and spring had strong effects on spring phenology. Although warm springs led to an advance of the growing season, warm conditions in winter caused a delay of the spring phases. This delay appeared to be related to later fulfillment of chilling requirements. Because most plants from temperate and cold climates experience a period of dormancy in winter, it seems likely that similar effects occur in other environments. Continued warming may strengthen this effect and attenuate or even reverse the advancing trend in spring phenology that has dominated climate-change responses of plants thus far.},

abstract = {The more commonly known statistical procedures, such as the t-test, analysis of variance, or chi-squared test, can handle only one dependent variable (DV) at a time. Two types of problems can arise when there is more than one DV: 1. a greater probability of erroneously concluding that there is a significant difference between the groups when in fact there is none (a Type I error); and 2. failure to detect differences between the groups in terms of the patterns of DVs (a Type II error). Multivariate statistics are designed to overcome both of these problems. However, there are costs associated with these benefits, such as increased complexity, decreased power, multiple ways of answering the same question, and ambiguity in the allocation of shared variance. This is the first of a series of articles on multivariate statistical tests which will address these issues and explain their possible uses.},

abstract = {On February 22, 2000, the Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at Kennedy Space Center, completing the highly successful 11-day flight of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Onboard were over 300 high-density tapes containing data for the highest resolution digital topographic map of Earth ever made.SRTM is a cooperative project between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) of the U.S. Department of Defense. The mission was designed to use a single-pass radar interferometer to produce a digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth's land surface between about 60 north and 56 south latitude. When completed, the DEM will have 30-m pixel spacing and about 15-m vertical accuracy. Two ortho-rectified image mosaics, one from the ascending passes with illumination from the southeast, and one from descending passes with illumination from the southwest, will also be produced (Figure 1).},

@article{Hunt1989,
abstract = {Detection of plant water stress by remote sensing has been proposed using indices of Near-Infrared (NIR, 0.7-1.3 $\mu$m) and Middle-Infrared (MIR, 1.3-2.5 $\mu$m) wavelengths. The first objective of this study was to test the ability of the Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI) to determine leaf Relative Water content (RWC) of different species with different leaf morphologies. The second objective was to determine how the Moisture Stress Index (MSI; MIR / NIR) varies with RWC and the Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). Reflectance factors at 0.82 $\mu$m and 1.6 $\mu$m were measured on leaves of Quercus agrifolia (sclerophyllous leaves), Liquidambar styraciflua (hardwood deciduous tree leaves), Picea rubens and Picea pungens (conifer needles), and Glycine max (herbaceous dicot leaves) as they dried on a laboratory bench. RWC and EWT were measured concurrently with the reflectance measurements. The results showed that LWCI was equal to RWC for the species tested. However, the results of a sensitivity analysis indicated the reflectances at 1.6 $\mu$m for two different RWC must be known for accurate prediction of unknown RWC; thus the LWCI is impractical for field applications. MSI was linearly correlated to RWCwith each species having a different regression equation and to log10 EWT with data of all species falling on the same regression line. Because EWT is correlated with leaf area index, MSI should also be correlated with leaf area index. Assuming that the linear regression equation of MSI to EWT can be applied to canopies, then the minimum significant change of RWC that can be detected is 52{\%}. For most plants, the natural variation in RWC from water stress is only about 20{\%}, so that we conclude that indices derived from NIR and MIR reflectances cannot be used to remotely-sense water stress. {\textcopyright} 1989.},
